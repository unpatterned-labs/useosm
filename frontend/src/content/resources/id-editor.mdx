## Why Use Id-editor?

JOSM is perfect for users who need more precision than web-based editors provide. It’s suited for complex tasks like mapping entire neighborhoods, fixing data errors, or integrating external datasets. For example, you can trace a building’s outline from satellite imagery, add tags like building=house, and connect it to a road network with proper attributes. Its offline capability is also great for fieldwork in areas with limited internet.
