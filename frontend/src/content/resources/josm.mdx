description: "JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor) is a free, open-source desktop application designed for editing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Itâ€™s a powerful tool used by OSM contributors to create, modify, and manage geospatial data, such as roads, buildings, and points of interest (POIs) like shops or parks. Unlike web-based editors like iD, JOSM offers advanced features for precise editing, making it ideal for users who want more control over their mapping tasks. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, requiring Java to operate."

## Why Use JOSM?

JOSM is perfect for users who need more precision than web-based editors provide. Itâ€™s suited for complex tasks like mapping entire neighborhoods, fixing data errors, or integrating external datasets. For example, you can trace a buildingâ€™s outline from satellite imagery, add tags like building=house, and connect it to a road network with proper attributes. Its offline capability is also great for fieldwork in areas with limited internet.
