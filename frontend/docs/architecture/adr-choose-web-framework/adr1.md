By rendering components on the server and sending lightweight HTML to the browser, Astro significantly improves performance with minimal JavaScript overhead. Most importantly, Astro makes it easy for the OSM community to contribute and update content at any time, helping us keep the platform fresh, relevant, and truly collaborative.
