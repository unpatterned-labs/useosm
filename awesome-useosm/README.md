## What Is OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the largest and most important open-source projects in the world.

It is a **global, community-built geographic database**, maintained by millions of contributors who map roads, buildings, paths, land use, and places—often in regions where no other reliable map exists.

Just as **Wikipedia democratized knowledge**,  
**OpenStreetMap democratized geography**.

Today, OSM powers:
- Navigation and routing
- Emergency and humanitarian response (aid)
- Urban planning and smart cities
- Climate research and environmental protection
- Logistics, mobility, and location intelligence

---

## What Is UseOSM?

**UseOSM** is about visibility and appreciation.

It exists to highlight:
- **Companies** using OSM data in production
- **Organizations & NGOs** relying on OSM for impact
- **Platforms & products** built on top of OSM
- **Supporters** contributing back to the ecosystem

Our focus is not only *who uses OSM*, but **how they use it and why it matters**.

## Why Organizations Choose OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is chosen because it is:

- **Truly global** and community-verified
- **Rapidly updated**, often faster than proprietary datasets
- Rich in **local, on-the-ground knowledge**
- Governed by an **open license**
- Designed so improvements benefit everyone
